## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned ho to use amock-up and build a working webpage. Gained an better understanding of the DOM and slowly improving my JS and CSS

### Continued development

Will continue to do more projects perfecting my CSS and JS. And will eventually refactor my projects using higher level code such as ReactJS and SCSS

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website is my go-to when it comes to seeing examples of different programming subjects. used this to also help myself build this project
